    dcterms:description "Geological substrates are materials and masses of earth or rock that do not show pedological development. They are not soils, but typically underlie them. The geological substrate includes the R horizon (continuous masses of rock, excluding pans, e.g. bedrock) and the part of the C horizon that shows no pedological development, but excludes the solum, buried soil horizons (including D horizons), and pans. The geological substrate beneath a soil profile may or may not be the parent material of the soil." ;
